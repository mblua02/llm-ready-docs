## 1. Executive Summary

MuleSoft Agent Fabric is an enterprise-grade agent management platform designed to maximize the potential of every AI agent, regardless of where it's built [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs). It addresses the critical challenge of "agent sprawl"—the fragmentation caused by disconnected AI agents across different teams, vendors, and platforms [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)].

As organizations deploy agents embedded in SaaS platforms, built in-house, or packaged with LLMs, they face "siloed" agents that cannot orchestrate actions across domains or adhere to security guardrails [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]. Agent Fabric transforms these uncontrolled agents into a **governed, coordinated, and intelligent network** [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro), [SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover), [SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern), [SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe), [SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)].

### The Four Pillars at a Glance

**Key Value Propositions:**

| Benefit | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Simplified Development** | Define agent processes using human-readable YAML rather than complex code | [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs) |
| **Safety and Governance** | Enterprise-grade guardrails ensuring control and compliance | [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)] |
| **Observability** | Visual traces of agent decision-making processes | [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)] |
| **Flexibility** | Coordinate any type of agent regardless of origin platform | [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs) |
| **Tool & Agent Invocation** | Manage both deterministic and probabilistic actions | [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)] |

Agent Fabric acts as an "air traffic controller" for the enterprise, providing a centralized backbone to discover, orchestrate, govern, and observe AI agents [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs). It leverages open standards including the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Agent2Agent (A2A)** protocols [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)].

## 2. The Problem - AI Agent Fragmentation

### 2.1 Origins of Fragmentation

AI Agent Fragmentation is described as a "modern" acceleration of the historical application sprawl problem. Just as organizations previously struggled to manage nearly 900 different applications spanning their business, they now face a similar explosion of AI agents [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)].

Siloed agents emerge from three primary sources within the enterprise ecosystem [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:

| Vector | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Embedded SaaS Agents** | Agents included natively within Software-as-a-Service platforms | Salesforce, Workday, Zendesk |
| **In-House Builds** | Custom agents developed by internal teams using various tech stacks | Python, LangChain workflows |
| **LLM Packaging** | Agents packaged alongside popular Large Language Models | Anthropic, OpenAI assistants |

### 2.2 The "Silo" Effect and Enterprise Blindness

Agents operating in fragmented environments are restricted to their native contexts [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:

- **Contextual Blindness:** The agent operates efficiently within its own application but remains unaware of the broader enterprise context [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]
- **Resource Isolation:** These agents cannot locate other tools, resources, or agents required to complete complex workflows [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover)
- **Orchestration Failure:** They are unable to coordinate actions across different ecosystems, limiting them to single-domain tasks [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover), [SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]

> "An agent typically promises to streamline tasks within its own application but is 'blind' to the rest of the organization." [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)]

### 2.3 Operational and Compliance Risks

The existence of siloed agents introduces critical constraints and risks [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:

| Impact Category | Description | Source |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Security & Compliance** | Lack of centralized control exposes the organization to security and compliance risks with no consistent guardrails | [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover), [SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)] |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Limited insight into how agents operate prevents process improvements | [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe) |
| **Data Integrity** | Disconnected agents lead to "trapped value," preventing multi-step cross-domain processes | [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover) |
| **User Experience** | Agents cannot access resources outside their silo, creating inconsistent experiences | [[SRC-INTRO]](#src-intro) |

### 2.4 The "Black Box" Problem

A critical aspect of fragmentation is the lack of observability [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:

- **Opacity:** IT teams do not know how agents are functioning, making decisions, or interacting with other systems [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe)
- **Optimization Barriers:** Without visibility into "dark" workflows, teams cannot fine-tune agents or optimize inefficient processes [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe)
- **Hallucination Risks:** Opacity leads to undetected bottlenecks and "hallucination errors" where agents generate inaccurate outputs without detection [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)]
- **Compliance Gaps:** Because agentic systems are non-deterministic, fragmentation makes it nearly impossible to audit *why* an agent took a specific action [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe)

---

## 3. Discover Pillar - Enterprise Agent Registry

### 3.1 Agent Registry Architecture

The "Discover" capability addresses the "unmanageable explosion" of disconnected AI agents by extending **Anypoint Exchange** into a centralized enterprise agent registry [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]. It is not a new standalone product but an evolution of the existing platform [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)].

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Sources["Agent Sources"]
        SAAS[SaaS Embedded<br/>Agents]
        INHOUSE[In-House<br/>Built Agents]
        LLM[LLM-Packaged<br/>Agents]
    end

    subgraph Registry["Agent Registry (Anypoint Exchange)"]
        METADATA[Metadata<br/>Repository]
        CATALOG[Asset<br/>Catalog]
        VERSIONS[Semantic<br/>Versioning]
    end

    subgraph Consumption["Consumption"]
        ACB[Anypoint Code<br/>Builder]
        VIBES[MuleSoft<br/>Vibes]
        YAML[YAML<br/>Definition]
    end

    SAAS --> METADATA
    INHOUSE --> METADATA
    LLM --> METADATA
    
    METADATA --> CATALOG
    CATALOG --> VERSIONS
    
    CATALOG --> ACB
    CATALOG --> VIBES
    ACB --> YAML
```

**Key Architecture Characteristics [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)]:**

- **Platform Agnostic:** The registry is designed to be neutral regarding the build platform—supports MuleSoft, Salesforce Agentforce, external tech stacks, or third-party SaaS products
- **Unified Enterprise Catalog:** Centralizes cataloging of AI assets regardless of their origin
- **Leverages Existing Infrastructure:** Uses the same infrastructure that has served thousands of customers for API management

### 3.2 Supported Asset Types

To support the "agentic" enterprise, the registry supports three specific new asset types alongside traditional APIs [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)], [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs):

| Asset Type | Description | Metadata Requirements |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **A2A Agents** | Autonomous agents designed for Agent-to-Agent interaction | Method (A2A card), Platform (MuleSoft/Agentforce/Other) |
| **MCP Servers** | Implementations of the Model Context Protocol providing standardized context to LLMs | MCP schema upload, Platform selection |
| **LLMs** | Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI, custom models) | Provider, Lifecycle state (Stable/Development) |
| **Traditional Assets** | APIs, RAML fragments, reusable data types | Standard API metadata |

### 3.3 Metadata Abstraction Pattern

The registry operates on a metadata level. If an agent is built outside of MuleSoft (e.g., a Python service or a LangChain workflow), its **metadata** is published to the registry [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]. This ensures:

- Implementation logic remains where it is best suited
- The asset remains discoverable and reusable across the enterprise
- Teams do not need to migrate code to MuleSoft—simply publish the metadata and schema [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover)

**Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Convergence [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:**

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Deterministic** | Structured, rigid processes requiring specific fields | API transactions like "Checkout" requiring address and credit card |
| **Non-Deterministic** | Dynamic reasoning to accomplish tasks based on available tools | LLMs figuring out how to complete a task |

The registry supports both, enabling architects to build systems where dynamic agents complement structured APIs [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover).

### 3.4 Publishing and Discovering Assets

#### Workflow: Publishing an Agent Asset [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]

1. Navigate to **Anypoint Exchange**
2. Click **"Publish new asset"**
3. Select the specific **Asset Type**: LLM, MCP Server, or Agent
4. Configure the asset metadata:
   - **For Agents:** Select method (A2A card), Platform (MuleSoft, Agentforce, Other)
     - **A2A Agent Card requirement:** The uploaded Agent Card must include the root `url` field (service endpoint). If missing, Exchange validation fails (e.g., `required key [url] not found`).
   - **For LLMs:** Select provider (e.g., OpenAI), Lifecycle State (Stable/Development)
   - **For MCP Servers:** Upload MCP schema, select platform
5. Click **"Publish"** to make the asset discoverable

#### Workflow: Consuming Assets in Anypoint Code Builder [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]

1. Open **Anypoint Code Builder**
2. Start a new **Agent Network Project**
3. **Discovery Phase:**
   - *Option A (AI-Assisted):* Use **MuleSoft Vibes** to prompt the system (e.g., "Find MCP servers for shipping")
   - *Option B (Manual):* Input the specific Asset Identifier and Version
4. **Definition Phase:** Selected assets are defined in the project's YAML configuration file

> **Note:** There is no drag-and-drop interface for browsing Exchange and placing agent assets into the canvas. Configuration must be done via YAML or Vibes prompts [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover).

### 3.5 MuleSoft Vibes - AI-Assisted Discovery

**MuleSoft Vibes** is an AI capability within Anypoint Code Builder that allows developers to use natural language to discover assets in Exchange [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:

- Enables prompts like "Find MCP servers for shipping" to locate assets
- Generates necessary configuration based on discovered assets
- Reduces the learning curve for developers new to Agent Fabric [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs)

### 3.6 Licensing and Constraints

**Licensing [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:**
- The Agent Registry (Discovery) is **included in the base MuleSoft subscription**
- Teams can begin cataloging agents immediately without additional procurement
- Other components (Orchestration, Governance, Observation) may require specific licenses [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)]

**Current Limitations [[SRC-DISCOVER](#src-discover)]:**

| Constraint | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Manual Synchronization** | Syncing agents between external registries and Agent Fabric is manual | Automated aggregation on roadmap |
| **No Drag-and-Drop** | Agent Network projects do not support visual drag-and-drop from Exchange | By design—YAML-based |
| **Closed Discovery** | Registry does not automatically scan enterprise network for unregistered assets | Assets must be explicitly registered |
| **No Agent API Templates** | Limited templates available at launch | Some example MCP servers provided |

---

## 4. Orchestrate Pillar - Agent Broker

### 4.1 Agent Broker Architecture

The **Agent Broker** is the core orchestration engine within MuleSoft Agent Fabric. It functions as a context-aware routing service that transforms isolated AI agents and deterministic tools into a coordinated network [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)].

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph DEFINITION["Definition Phase"]
        ACB[Anypoint Code Builder]
        YAML[Agent Network<br/>YAML Definition]
        ACB --> YAML
    end

    subgraph PUBLICATION["Publication Phase"]
        EXCHANGE[Anypoint Exchange<br/>Discovery & Reuse]
    end

    subgraph DEPLOYMENT["Deployment - CloudHub 2.0"]
        BROKER[Agent<br/>Broker]
        AGENT1[Agent 1]
        AGENT2[Agent 2]
        MCP[MCP<br/>Server]
    end

    subgraph GOVERNANCE["Governance Layer"]
        INGRESS[Ingress<br/>Flex Gateway]
        EGRESS[Egress<br/>Flex Gateway]
    end

    YAML --> EXCHANGE
    EXCHANGE --> BROKER
    EXCHANGE --> AGENT1
    EXCHANGE --> AGENT2
    EXCHANGE --> MCP
    
    INGRESS -.-> BROKER
    BROKER -.-> EGRESS
    AGENT1 -.-> EGRESS
    AGENT2 -.-> EGRESS
```

**Key Characteristics [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)]:**

- **Context-Aware Routing:** Routes based on request intent, policies, user identity, and runtime state
- **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** Uses Large Language Models for planning and decision-making
- **Task Decomposition:** Breaks complex processes into discrete steps handled by specialized agents
- **Reusability:** Brokers are themselves specialized agents that can be reused by other brokers
- **Dynamic Discovery:** Continuously discovers and engages the best-fit agents and assets

### 4.2 The Dual-Protocol Approach (A2A vs MCP)

The Agent Broker leverages two distinct AI protocols to communicate with both "thinking" agents and deterministic tools [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Broker["Agent Broker"]
        LLM_B[LLM<br/>Reasoning]
    end

    subgraph Delegation["A2A Protocol"]
        direction TB
        AGENT_A[Badging Agent]
        AGENT_B[Salesforce Agent]
        AGENT_C[Workday Agent]
    end

    subgraph Tools["MCP Protocol"]
        direction TB
        CALC[Calculator]
        DB[Database Query]
        LIGHT[IoT Controller]
    end

    Broker -->|"Complex Tasks<br/>Peer-to-Peer"| Delegation
    Broker -->|"Deterministic Tasks<br/>Tool Use"| Tools
```

| Feature | A2A (Agent-to-Agent) | MCP (Model Context Protocol) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Primary Role** | Delegation to a Peer | Execution of a Tool |
| **Intelligence** | "Thinker" (Has its own LLM/Reasoning) | "Doer" (Standard computer program) |
| **Interaction Modes** | Sync request/response, Streaming (SSE), Async push notifications | Input/Output (Function Call) |
| **Protocol Base** | JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S) | Tool Use Standard |
| **Discovery** | Agent Cards at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Tool definitions in configuration |
| **Example** | Requesting a "Badging Agent" to generate a badge | Using a "Calculator" to multiply numbers |
| **Origin** | Google → Linux Foundation (Open Standard) | Anthropic (Open Standard) |

**Source:** [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]

### 4.3 LLM-Powered Reasoning and Task Decomposition

The Broker uses its configured LLM to analyze natural language queries and intelligently delegate work [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:

1. **Intent Analysis:** LLM analyzes the request against configured instructions
2. **Tool Selection:** Determines whether to engage A2A agent or MCP tool
3. **Parameter Collection:** If missing information is detected, prompts user for specifics
4. **Result Synthesis:** Combines outputs from multiple agents/tools into final response

**Supported LLMs [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:**

| Status | Provider |
|--------|----------|
| **At Launch** | OpenAI (Direct API), Azure OpenAI |
| **Roadmap** | Salesforce Einstein, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Claude |

### 4.4 YAML-Based Configuration

Agent Network Projects are defined using **YAML-based definition files** rather than traditional Mule flow XML [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)], [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs):

```yaml
# Example Agent Network Configuration Structure
broker:
  name: "Employee Onboarding Broker"
  llm: 
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  instructions: |
    Calculating arithmetic should never be done by agents; 
    always use the calculator tool.
  agents:
    - name: "Badging Agent"
      protocol: "a2a"
      endpoint: "https://..."
    - name: "Workday Agent"
      protocol: "a2a"
  tools:
    - name: "Calculator"
      protocol: "mcp"
```

**Key Configuration Elements [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)]:**

- **LLM Provider:** GPT-4o Mini, Azure OpenAI, etc.
- **Agents:** External agents defined using A2A
- **Tools:** MCP servers for deterministic execution
- **Instructions:** Plain English instructions guiding routing decisions

### 4.5 Human-in-the-Loop Patterns

The Broker supports **Multi-turn** interactions and **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** patterns [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)]:

- **Scenario:** Broker determines it lacks specific information (e.g., sales territory assignment)
- **Action:** Pauses automated flow and requests missing information via chat interface
- **Resumption:** Once user responds, Broker continues orchestration steps

> "The Agent Broker pauses to ask the user via Slack for a specific territory assignment. Upon receiving the input, the Broker proceeds to provision IT assets and request a badge." [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)]

### 4.6 Infrastructure Requirements

**Mandatory Infrastructure [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:**

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Runtime Environment** | Private Space in CloudHub 2.0 | Required for Broker deployment |
| **Gateway** | Managed Flex Gateway | Must include both Ingress and Egress |
| **Gateway Mode** | Managed mode only | Connected mode NOT supported |
| **LLM** | Bring Your Own LLM (BYO-LLM) | OpenAI/Azure OpenAI at launch |
| **IDE** | Anypoint Code Builder | Extension Pack v1.11.5+ |

### 4.7 Operational Flow and Deployment

#### Deployment Process [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]

1. **Publish:** Execute `mulesoft publish agent network assets` to push artifacts to Exchange
2. **Deploy:** Execute `mulesoft deploy agent network` to deploy to Private Space
3. **Configure Gateway:** Ensure Ingress/Egress gateways are configured

#### Runtime Execution Flow [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]

1. **Ingest:** User sends natural language query via HTTP (A2A protocol)
2. **Reasoning:** Broker's LLM analyzes request based on YAML instructions
3. **Routing/Delegation:**
   - *Agent Delegation:* A2A request to sub-agent (e.g., Badging Agent)
   - *Tool Use:* MCP request to tool (e.g., Calculator)
4. **Feedback Loop:** If parameters missing, Broker prompts user
5. **Response:** Broker synthesizes results and returns final answer

**Constraints [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:**

- **Static Topology:** Available agents must be pre-connected and defined in YAML; no auto-discovery at runtime
- **Node Limits:** Soft limit of ~25 nodes per network to prevent complexity and hallucination risks
- **Broker Chaining:** For larger requirements, use "brokers using other brokers" pattern

---

## 5. Govern Pillar - Security and Compliance

### 5.1 Flex Gateway as Enforcement Point

Agent Governance is implemented by extending the existing **Flex Gateway** to support AI protocols [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:

- Extends standard API gateway capabilities to support **MCP** and **A2A** interactions
- Decouples governance from agent logic
- Enforces security, compliance, and traffic controls regardless of agent hosting location [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]

**Infrastructure Components [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Flex Gateway** | Primary enforcement point for agent governance |
| **CloudHub 2.0** | Hosts MCP servers and Agents |
| **API Manager** | Defines and attaches policies to gateways |
| **Mule Chain Connectors** | Builds agents that reason using LLMs |

### 5.2 Policy Types

Four specific A2A/MCP policies are available out-of-the-box [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)], [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)]:

| Policy | Target | Purpose | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Client ID Enforcement** | Agent & MCP Server | Authentication/Authorization | Ensures only authorized consumers can invoke |
| **A2A PII Detector** | Agent | Compliance | Scans prompts for SSN, Credit Cards; blocks or logs |
| **MCP Schema Validation** | MCP Server | Traffic Control | Validates requests adhere to MCP tool definition |
| **Prompt Decorator** | Agent | Context Enhancement | Injects contextual information into prompts |
| **Agent Card Policy** | Agent | Metadata Management | Rewrites Agent Card URL to gateway URL |

### 5.3 Ingress and Egress Control Architecture

Governance in Agent Fabric is bidirectional [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:

```mermaid

    subgraph External["External Zone"]
        CLIENT[Client Request]
        EXT_SVC[External Services]
    end

    subgraph Ingress["Ingress Protection"]
        AUTH[Authentication]
        AUTHZ[Authorization]

        VALID[Input Validation]
    end

    subgraph Internal["Internal Zone"]
        BROKER((Agent<br/>Broker))
        AGENTS[Agents]
        MCP_S[MCP Servers]
    end

    subgraph Egress["Egress Control"]
        DLP[Data Loss<br/>Prevention]
        LP[Least Privilege]
        AUDIT[Audit Logging]
    end

    CLIENT --> AUTH
    AUTH --> AUTHZ
    AUTHZ --> PII_IN
    PII_IN --> VALID
    VALID --> BROKER
    BROKER <--> AGENTS
    BROKER <--> MCP_S
    AGENTS --> DLP
    MCP_S --> DLP
    DLP --> LP
    LP --> AUDIT
    AUDIT --> EXT_SVC
```

**Layered Security Approach [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:**

| Layer | Component | Applied Policies | Role |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------|
| **Agent Layer** | Agent Cart (Mule App with LLM) | Client ID Enforcement, A2A PII Detector | Protects reasoning engine, blocks sensitive data |
| **Tooling Layer** | MCP Server (Mule App as Tools) | Client ID Enforcement, MCP Schema Validation | Protects backend systems, validates protocol |

### 5.4 Behavioral Guardrails via YAML Instructions

Beyond network-level governance, Agent Fabric enables "logic governance" via configuration [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:

- Plain English instructions in YAML act as strict guardrails for LLM reasoning
- Dictate which tools must be used for specific tasks
- Prevent hallucinations by forcing deterministic execution where appropriate

**Example:**
```yaml
instructions: |
  Calculating arithmetic should never be done by agents; 
  always use the calculator tool.
  Never process requests containing personal financial information.
```

### 5.5 Zero Trust Principles

Agent Fabric implements Zero Trust security [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs):

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Never Trust, Always Verify** | Client ID Enforcement at every layer |
| **Least Privilege** | Egress gateway ensures agents only access authorized external tools |
| **Micro-segmentation** | Separate policies for Agent and MCP Server layers |
| **Continuous Verification** | Every interaction checked by Flex Gateway |

### 5.6 Policy Enforcement Workflow

**Step-by-Step Flow [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:**

1. **Request Initiation:** User sends prompt via client app to Agent API
2. **Gateway Check 1 (Auth):** Flex Gateway validates **Client ID Enforcement**
   - *If unauthorized:* Request stops, "not authorized" error returned
3. **Gateway Check 2 (Content):** Flex Gateway executes **A2A PII Detector**
   - *If PII detected:* Request rejected, "PII data sensitive" error
4. **Agent Processing:** Clean request sent to Agent for LLM reasoning
5. **Gateway Check 3 (Service Auth):** Agent calls MCP Server; **Client ID** validated
6. **Gateway Check 4 (Protocol):** **MCP Schema Validation** ensures format compliance
7. **Execution:** Tool executes logic and returns result

**Example - Blocking PII Injection [[SRC-GOVERN](#src-govern)]:**
> User types: "Register new employee... SSN: [Redacted]."
> A2A PII Detector policy analyzes the prompt.
> Request rejected with: "Request contains PII sensitive data of type SSN."
> Agent does not process the data.

## 6. Observe Pillar - Agent Visualizer

### 6.1 Agent Visualizer Components

**Agent Visualizer** provides comprehensive tools to transform non-transparent networks into actionable insights [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:

```mermaid

        AUDIT[Compliance<br/>Audit Trail]
    end

    RUNTIME --> MAP
    GATEWAY --> INSIGHTS
    APPS --> TRACES
    
    MAP --> HEALTH
    INSIGHTS --> BOTTLENECK
    TRACES --> AUDIT
```

#### Component 1: The Visual Map [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]

- **Function:** Displays an interactive graph of the agent network
- **Nodes Displayed:** Agent Broker, Agents, MCP Servers, LLMs
- **Asset Details:** Clicking a node reveals metadata, platform, LLM used, and links to Exchange documentation

#### Component 2: Anypoint Insights (Monitoring) [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Request Volume** | Total requests over configurable timeframe |
| **Performance Trends** | Visual representation of load over time |
| **Response Times** | Aggregate latency data |
| **Error Rates** | Tracking of failed requests |

#### Component 3: Traces (Deep Dive) [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]

- **Function:** Tracks specific request flow through entire service pipeline
- **Granularity:** Shows exact path (Broker → Mule Flow → Shopping Broker → Fruit Agents)
- **Performance Analysis:** Displays exact execution time for each hop
- **Log Integration:** "View Logs" button for direct root cause analysis

### 6.2 Performance Monitoring Metrics

**Key Metrics Tracked [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:**

| Category | Metrics | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Traffic** | Request volume, requests per second | [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe) |
| **Latency** | Response times, time per hop | [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe) |
| **Errors** | Error rates, failed requests | [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe), [SRC-DOCS](#src-docs)] |
| **Performance** | Trends over configurable periods (1h, 6h, 24h) | [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe) |

### 6.3 End-to-End Tracing and Debugging

**Debugging Workflow [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:**

1. **Detection:** View Anypoint Insights, note request volume and response trends
2. **Investigation:** Drill down into Traces for specific request
3. **Analysis:** Review timing of each hop to identify delays
4. **Resolution:** Use "View Logs" to inspect error messages

**Trace View Features:**

- Hop-by-hop visibility showing exact request path
- Execution time displayed for each invocation
- Direct link to log management for root cause analysis

### 6.4 Compliance Auditing for Non-Deterministic Systems

**The Challenge [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:**

Agentic systems are **non-deterministic**—they take actions on the fly based on LLM reasoning. In regulated industries (healthcare, finance), simply seeing the result is insufficient.

**The Solution:**

- **Trace** capability provides historical proof of decision path, tool usage, and reasoning flow
- Creates auditable records of *why* an agent took a specific action
- Essential for regulatory compliance (e.g., patient prescription decisions) [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe)

> "Organizations must be able to explain *why* the agent took a specific action. The Trace capability provides the necessary historical proof." [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]

### 6.5 Log Integration and Root Cause Analysis

**Integrated Troubleshooting Workflow [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:**

1. **Insights** → High-level health assessment
2. **Traces** → Bottleneck identification
3. **Logs** → Root cause analysis

**LLM Reasoning Visibility [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]:**

- Logs reveal exactly which tool the LLM selected and why
- Operators can see exact input sent to a tool and output returned
- Enables auditability of the AI's decision path

**Current Limitations [[SRC-OBSERVE](#src-observe)]:**

| Limitation | Current State | Roadmap |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| **MCP Granularity** | MCP Server shown as single node | Specific tool invocations coming soon |
| **Tool-Level Visibility** | Cannot see which specific tool within MCP was called | Future enhancement |

## 10. Final Takeaways

### 10.1 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Centralize Discovery Immediately**
   - Begin cataloging existing "shadow" agents in Anypoint Exchange [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover)
   - Register Python scripts, LangChain workflows, and external agents
   - Establish registration protocols requiring all new assets to be published [[SRC-DISCOVER]](#src-discover)

2. **Adopt the Dual-Protocol Pattern**
   - Use **A2A** for agent delegation requiring reasoning
   - Use **MCP** for deterministic tool execution
   - Prevent hallucination by forcing math/logic to MCP tools [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE]](#src-orchestrate)

3. **Implement Dual-Layer Governance**
   - Apply policies at both Agent and MCP Server layers
   - Configure both Ingress and Egress gateways
   - Use Client ID Enforcement at every boundary [[SRC-GOVERN]](#src-govern)

4. **Mandate Observability from Day One**
   - Do not deploy agents without monitoring enabled
   - Use Traces for compliance auditing in regulated industries
   - Integrate troubleshooting workflow: Insights → Traces → Logs [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe)

### 10.2 Implementation Priorities

| Priority | Action | Timeline | Dependency |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| **P0** | Audit existing agents across organization | Immediate | None |
| **P1** | Register agents in Anypoint Exchange | Week 1-2 | Audit complete |
| **P2** | Provision Private Space + Managed Flex Gateway | Week 2-3 | Platform access |
| **P3** | Define first Agent Network in YAML | Week 3-4 | Infrastructure ready |
| **P4** | Apply governance policies | Week 4-5 | Deployment complete |
| **P5** | Configure Agent Visualizer | Week 5-6 | Monitoring enabled |

### 10.3 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Description | Mitigation | Source |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Context Rot** | Exposing System APIs directly as MCP tools overloads LLM | Wrap in Process/Experience APIs | [[SRC-INTRO]](#src-intro) |
| **LLM Math** | Allowing LLM to perform calculations | Force to Calculator MCP | [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE]](#src-orchestrate) |
| **Single-Layer Security** | Only applying policies to Broker | Secure both Agent and MCP layers | [[SRC-GOVERN]](#src-govern) |
| **Ignoring Egress** | Only governing inbound traffic | Configure Egress gateway for outbound | [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE]](#src-orchestrate) |
| **Unmonitored Deployment** | Deploying agents without observability | Enable Visualizer before production | [[SRC-OBSERVE]](#src-observe) |
| **Transformation in Broker** | Putting DataWeave in Broker YAML | Handle transforms in underlying API | [[SRC-INTRO]](#src-intro) |
| **Node Overload** | Exceeding ~25 nodes per network | Use broker-of-brokers pattern | [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE]](#src-orchestrate) |

**Problem:** Exposing System APIs directly as MCP tools causes "context rot"—overloading the LLM with irrelevant information.

**Solution:**
```
System APIs → Process APIs → Experience APIs → MCP Server

Example:
- System: /customers/{id}, /orders/{id}, /inventory/{sku}
- Process: /customer-order-history/{id}
- Experience: /customer-360/{id}
- MCP Tool: get_customer_profile
```

#### Pattern 2: Broker-of-Brokers [[SRC-ORCHESTRATE](#src-orchestrate)]

**Problem:** Single broker exceeds ~25 node complexity limit.

**Solution:**
```
Master Broker
├── HR Broker
│   ├── Workday Agent
│   ├── Benefits Agent
│   └── Onboarding MCP
├── IT Broker
│   ├── Zendesk Agent
│   ├── Badge Agent
│   └── Provisioning MCP
└── Sales Broker
    ├── Salesforce Agent
    └── Territory MCP
```

#### Pattern 3: Separation of Concerns [[SRC-INTRO](#src-intro)]

| Concern | Handled By | NOT Handled By |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Data Transformation | API Implementation, MCP Tool | Broker YAML |
| Error Handling | Individual Agents/Tools | Broker centrally |
| Business Logic | Underlying Services | Broker YAML |
| Routing Logic | Broker YAML, LLM Reasoning | Agents |

### A.3 Security Architecture

#### Zero Trust Implementation [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Ingress as Ingress Gateway
    participant Broker
    participant Egress as Egress Gateway
    participant External as External Service

    Client->>Ingress: 1. Request
    Ingress->>Ingress: 2. Authenticate (Client ID)
    Ingress->>Ingress: 3. Authorize (RBAC)
    Ingress->>Ingress: 4. Scan PII
    Ingress->>Ingress: 5. Validate Schema
    Ingress->>Broker: 6. Clean Request
    Broker->>Broker: 7. LLM Reasoning
    Broker->>Egress: 8. Outbound Request
    Egress->>Egress: 9. Verify Authorization
    Egress->>Egress: 10. Apply Least Privilege
    Egress->>Egress: 11. Audit Log
    Egress->>External: 12. Authorized Request
    External-->>Client: 13. Response
```

#### RBAC Propagation [[SRC-DOCS]](#src-docs)

- Centralized credentials management
- Audit trails for all interactions
- Policy inheritance across the network
- Separation of duties enforcement

### B.5 Customer-Facing Messaging Templates

#### Executive Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Your enterprise likely has dozens of AI agents—in Salesforce, Workday, custom builds—all operating in silos. MuleSoft Agent Fabric transforms these disconnected agents into a governed, intelligent network. You get a central registry to find and reuse agents, intelligent orchestration to coordinate cross-domain processes, enterprise-grade governance for compliance, and full observability into every AI decision."

#### Discovery Qualification Questions

1. "How many AI agents are currently deployed across your organization?"
2. "Do you have visibility into how your agents make decisions?"
3. "Have you experienced compliance concerns with AI-driven processes?"
4. "Are different teams building similar agent capabilities?"
5. "Can your agents today coordinate across Salesforce, Workday, and custom systems?"

#### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're already using [competitor]" | "Agent Fabric is protocol-agnostic. We can orchestrate agents from any platform, including [competitor], through our open A2A protocol." |
| "We built our own orchestration" | "Custom orchestration often lacks governance and observability. Agent Fabric adds enterprise-grade security and compliance without replacing what you've built." |
| "Our agents work fine today" | "Individual agents may work well, but can they coordinate across systems? Agent Fabric enables end-to-end automation that isolated agents cannot achieve." |
| "It's too early for agent governance" | "Early governance is easier than retrofitting. Start with Discovery—it's included in your base subscription—and add governance as you scale." |
